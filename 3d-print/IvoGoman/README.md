# Simple Case

Based on the original Simple Case design.

## Changes

1. Added notches for up to 1cm diameter bumpons on the bottom of the case
2. Added notches to the inside of the case. Not strictly necessary but makes the case compatible with the screws and stand-offs included in the kit. Otherwise you can simple use 4 additional 4mm M2 screws.
